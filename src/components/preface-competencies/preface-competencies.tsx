    The BioExcel training programme is based on a competency profile. A
    competency is an observable ability of any professional, integrating
    multiple components such as knowledge, skills and behaviours. A competency
    profile lists and defines all the competencies that an individual might need
    to fulfil a particular role, or that define specific user groups. Together
    with our user community we have defined the knowledge and skills that we
    think are relevant for people working in computational biomolecular
    research. In total we have defined 31 competencies and they are grouped
    together in four large categories. You can browse them in the table below,
    under each competency there is a link to all the training resources that we
    have identified as relevant.
